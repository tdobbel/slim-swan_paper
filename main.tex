\title{Estimating the impact of a major hurricane on transport processes}
\author{Thomas Dobbelaere, Emmanuel Hanert}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In most hydrodynamic model studies, currents and waves are simulated separately. This is especially true for the simulation of passive drifters, whose trajectories are often computed based solely on currents. Although this simplification holds for most situations, as the force exerted by waves on currents can be neglected in fair weather conditions, it may lead to significant errors in storm conditions, during which local currents are strongly influenced by wind-generated waves. In this study, current-wave interactions in heavy-wind conditions are studied by coupling the unstructured-mesh hydrodynamic model SLIM with the wave model SWAN in the Florida Reef Tract during Hurricane Irma (Sep. 2017). This coupled model successfully reproduced both the observed wave behavior and storm surge during the hurricane. The modeled currents were then used to simulate the trajectories of passive drifters during the passage of the hurricane. Our results show that taking wave force into account induces variations of up 1 m/s in modelled currents on the continental shelf break as well as in the vicinity of reefs and islands. Wave-current interactions can therefore deflect the trajectories of drifting material by up to 10 km on the passage of the storm \textcolor{red}{Add something?}. These results strongly advocate for the inclusion of wave forces while studying transport processes (sediments, pollutants, larvae, etc.) under storm conditions

% === INTRODUCTION === %
\section{Introduction}

Wave-current interactions in coastal areas are of great importance for coastal engineering as they play a key role in sediment transport, morphological evolution and pollutant mixing \citep{bever2013simulating, li1998three}. However, these interactions are highly nonlinear and can vary significantly in space and time \citep{wu2011fvcom}. Wave-induced currents are generated by wave radiation gradients \citep{longuet1970longshore}, affecting water levels near shorelines and wave breaking points \citep{longuet1964radiation}, while changes in water levels and currents, in turn, affect the motion and evolution of waves \citep{sikiric2013coupling}. Coupled wave-current models are therefore required to capture these complex interactions.

As coastal oceans are characterized by local complex geometries with islands, inlets and estuaries, unstructured (usually two-dimensional) models are preferred as structured grid models show limitations in resolving topologically controlled nearshore processes \citep{wu2011fvcom, chen2007finite}. The effect of wave-interactions becomes even more significant in the case of hurricanes, that generate large wind-waves and disturb ocean conditions \citep{liu2020impacts} by causing coastal upwellings on continental shelves \citep{smith1982response} and inducing strong currents, waves and storm surges in nearshore and coastal regions \citep{dietrich2010high, weisberg2006hurricane}. South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes \citep{malmstadt2009florida} and modelling studies predict tropical cyclones to increase both in frequency and intensity in this region \citep{marsooli2019climate, knutson2010tropical}. Being able to accurately model wave-current interactions in this area becomes thus critical.

Individual-based modelling of particulates has been extensively used to study the transport of drifting materials such as pollutants, sediments or larvae \citep{garcia2020measuring,liubartseva2018tracking, figueiredo2013synthesizing, frys2020fine}. Although some of these studies take the impact of waves into account by adding Stokes drift velocity, \ie the net drift of a floating particle in the direction of the wave propagation \citep{van2018stokes}, to the Eulerian currents, they usually neglect the wave-induced currents. Such practice is reasonable in the case of fair weather, when wave-induced forces exerted on currents are relatively smaller, but might lead to significant inaccuracies during storm conditions. To assess the importance of wave-current interactions during a tropical cyclone, we investigated the transport of drifting particulates on the Florida shelf during Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest and costliest tropical cyclones on records in the Atlantic Basin \citep{chen2007finite}, that made landfall in Florida in September 2017.

In this study, we developed an unstructured coupled wave-current model of South Florida to simulate the ocean circulation during hurricane Irma. Both modelled currents and waves were validated against field measurements and were then used to simulate the transport of drifting material in the Florida Keys and the Florida inner shelf during the storm. Model outputs were then compared with uncoupled simulation results in order to assess the impact of wave-induced forces and Stokes drift on the modelled currents and transports.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study area and data}
Large-scale ocean circulation around South Florida is dominated by the Florida Current (FC), which originates from the Loop Currents (LC) where it enters the Florida Straits from the Gulf of Mexico, and, downstream, forms the Gulf Stream. The FC is a major western boundary current characterized by spatial variability and meandering, associated with the presence of cyclonic eddies between the core of the current and the complex reef topography of the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) \citep{lee1995florida,kourafalou2012florida}. The northern half of these reefs are made of early Holocene reef frameworks and indurated sand ridges while the southern part (the Florida Keys) is composed of a chain of limestone islands, fossilized remnants of ancient coral reefs and sand bars \citep{hoffmeister1968geology,shinn1988geology,lidz1991paleoshorelines}. The variability of the FC extends over a large range of spatial and temporal scales, with periods of 30-70 days in the Lower Keys \citep{lee1995florida} and shorter periods of 2-21 days in the Upper Keys \citep{lee1977low}, and exhibits significant seasonal and interannual cycles \citep{johns1987meandering, lee1988wind,schott1988variability}. Circulation on the West Florida Shelf (WFS) on the other hand is forced by local winds and tidal fluctuations \citep{lee2002volume,liu2012seasonal}.

Field observations were used to validate our model outputs. Modelled sea surface elevation was validated against tide gauge measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) Tides and Currents dataset. These measurements were taken at four locations: two in the Florida Keys (Key West and Vaca Key); one on the eastern coast of Florida (Key West); and one on the western coast (Naples). Currents were validated against ADCP measurements from the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science's (USF/CMS) Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS) for the WFS \citep{weisberg2009mean}. More specifically, we used measurements from moorings C10, C12 and C13, respectively located at the 25, 50, and 50 m isobaths of the WFS \citep{liu2020impacts}. Finally, validation of modelled wave parameters was performed against four buoy measurements from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC): two on Florida's Eastern shelf and two on the WFS. The locations of all measurement stations are shown on Fig. \ref{fig:mesh}

\subsection{Wind and atmospheric pressure for Hurricane Irma}
Irma made landfall in Florida on 10 September 2017 as a category 3 storm, first at Cudjoe Key (Florida Keys) and later on Marco Island, south to Naples (see hurricane track in Fig. \ref{fig:mesh}). It then weakened to a category 2 storm as it moved further inland \citep{pinelli2018overview}. The storm caused damages to up to 75\% of the buildings at his landfall point in the Florida Keys, making it one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin \citep{xian2018brief,zhang2019modeling}. The strongest reported wind speed was 50 m/s on Marco Island while the highest recorded storm surge was 2.3 m, although larger wind speed likely occurred in the Florida Keys \citep{pinelli2018overview}
In order to reproduce the wind profile of Irma in our model, high-resolution H$^\ast$Wind \citep{powell1998hrd} wind fields were used. As these data represent 1-min averaged wind speeds, we multiplied them by a factor 0.93 to obtain 10-min averaged wind speeds \citep{harper2010guidelines}, more consistent with the time step of our model. Furthermore, H*Wind wind profiles did not cover the whole model extent during the hurricane and were thus blended within coarser wind field extracted from ECMWF ERA-5 datasets. Pressure fields of Irma were also constructed using ERA-5 data. However, the coarse resolution of the data set caused the depression at the center of the hurricane to get smoothed out, leading to an underestimation of the pressure gradient in our model. To better capture the central depression of Irma, we built a hybrid pressure field using the position and the minimal pressure of the core of the hurricane based on its track in the HURDAT 2 database \citep{landsea2013atlantic}. Based on this information, the hybrid pressure field was constructed by combining an idealized Holland pressure profile \citep{lin2012hurricane} within the radius of maximum wind speed of Irma \citep{knaff2018statistical} with ERA-5 pressure field. The transition between from the Holland profile to ERA-5 data outside the radius of maximum wind speed data was performed using a smooth step function.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic model}
Ocean currents generated during hurricane Irma around South Florida were modelled using the 2D barotropic verdion of the unstructured-mesh coastal ocean model SLIM\footnote{\url{https://www.slim-ocean.be}}. The model mesh covers an area similar to the model extent of \cite{dobbelaere2020coupled}, that includes the FRT but also the Florida Strait and part of the Gulf of Mexico (Figure \ref{fig:mesh}). However, this area has been slightly extended northeastward and westward in order to include the NOAA-NDBC boys. Furthermore, in order to withstand potential cell drying due to storm conditions in this study, we solved the conservative shallow water equations with wetting-drying, that write:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \dfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} +\nabla\cdot(\UV) =& ~0 \\
        \dfrac{\partial \UV}{\partial t}  + \nabla\cdot\left(\dfrac{\UV\UV}{H}\right) =& -f\mathbf{e}_z \times \UV + \alpha gH\nabla(H-h) - \dfrac{1}{\rho}\nabla p_\text{atm} + \dfrac{1}{\rho}\text{\boldmath$\tau$}_s \\
         &+\nabla\cdot(\nu\nabla\UV) - \dfrac{C_b}{H^2}|\UV|\UV + \gamma(\UV_\ast-\UV)
    \end{split} \label{eq:slim}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the water column height and $\UV$ is the depth-averaged transport; $f$ is the Coriolis coefficient; $g$ is the gravitational acceleration; $h$ is the bathymetry; $\alpha$ is a coefficient stating whether the mesh element is wet ($\alpha=1$) or dry ($\alpha=0$); $\nu$  is the viscosity; $C_b$ is the bulk bottom drag coefficient; $\nabla p_\text{atm}$ is the atmospheric pressure gradient; {\boldmath$\tau$}$_s$ is the surface stress due to wind; and $\gamma$ is a relaxation coefficient towards a reference transport $\UV_\ast$. As in \cite{frys2020fine} and \cite{dobbelaere2020coupled}, SLIM currents were gradually relaxed towards \hycom \citep{chassignet2007hycom} in regions where the water depth exceeds 50m.

At very high wind speeds, the white cap is blown off the crest of the waves, which generates a layer of droplets that acts as a slip layer for the winds at the ocean-atmosphere interface \citep{holthuijsen2012wind}. This causes a saturation of the wind drag coefficient for strong winds \citep{donelan2004limiting,powell2003reduced}. To account for the impact of this saturation on the surface wind stress in our model, we implemented the wind drag parameterization of \cite{moon2007physics}. In this parameterization, the drag coefficient $C_d$ depends on the wind speed at 10-m height $U_{10}$ according to:
\begin{equation}
    C_d = \kappa^2 \log\left(\dfrac{10}{z_0}\right)^{-2}\label{eq:drag}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is the von Karman constant. The roughness length $z_0$ in Eq. \ref{eq:drag} is a function of the 10-m wind speed $U_{10}$, whose expression writes: 
\begin{equation}
    z_0 =\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}
        \dfrac{0.0185}{g}U_{\ast}^2 & \text{if }U_{10} \leq 12.5\text{ m/s} \\
        \lbrack 0.085(-0.56U_{\ast}^2+20.255U_{\ast} & \text{if }U_{10} > 12.5\text{ m/s} \\
        \quad +2.548) - 0.58\rbrack\times 10^{-3} 
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
with $U_\ast$ the friction velocity. The relation between $U_{10}$ and $U_{\ast}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    U_{10}=-0.56U_{\ast}^2+20.255U_{\ast}+2.458
\end{equation} 
\textcolor{red}{The mesh resolution depended on the distance to coastlines and reefs, bathymetry and bathymetry gradient in order to satisfy SWAN refinement criterion $h/A\geq a$, where $h$ is the water depth and $A$ is the element area}. The mesh was generated using the Python library seamsh\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/seamsh/}}, based on the the open-source mesh generator GMSH \citep{geuzaine2009gmsh} and is composed of approximately 7.7 $\times$ 10$^5$ elements. The coarsest elements, far away from the FRT, had a characteristic length size of about 5 km, as shown in Fig \ref{fig:mesh} along with the bathymetry of the model domain.

\subsection{Wave model}
Waves were modelled using parallel unstructured SWAN \citep{booij1999third} on the same mesh as SLIM. This model solves the action balance equation, which reads \citep{mei1989applied}:
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t} + \nabla_\mathbf{x}\cdot[(\mathbf{c}_g+\mathbf{u})N] + \dfrac{\partial }{\partial \theta}[c_\theta N] + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \sigma}[c_\sigma N] = \dfrac{S_{in}+S_{ds}+S_{nl}}{\sigma} \label{eq:swan}
\end{equation}
where $N=E/\sigma$ is the wave action density; $\theta$ is the wave propagation direction; $\sigma$ is the wave relative frequency; $\mathbf{c}_g$ is the wave group velocity, $\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{U}/H$ is SLIM depth-averaged current velocity; $c_\theta$ and $c_\sigma$ are the propagation velocities in spectral space due to refraction and shifting in frequency due to variations in depth and currents; and $S_{in}$, $S_{ds}$, and $S_{nl}$ respectively represent wave growth by wind, wave decay and nonlinear transfers of wave energy through interactions between triplets and quadruplets. Spectra were discretized with 48 direction bins and 50 frequency bins logarithmically distributed from 0.3 to 2 Hz. Exponential wind growth was parameterized using the formulation of \cite{janssen1991quasi}, while dissipations by whitecapping and bottom dissipations followed the formulations of \cite{komen1984existence} and \cite{madsen1989spectral} respectively. Coefficients for exponential wind growth and whitecapping parameterizations were based on the results of \cite{siadatmousavi2011evaluation}. \textcolor{red}{[Insist that not the default parameterization]}. Finally, wave boundary conditions were derived from WAVEWATCH III \citep{tolman2009user} spectral outputs at buoy locations. \textcolor{red}{TODO: more info on Stokes drift} Depth-averaged Stokes drift was also computed by SWAN using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{u}_{s} = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{+\infty} \dfrac{\sigma^3}{h\tanh(2kh)}E(\sigma,\theta)(\cos\theta, \sin(\theta))d\sigma d\theta
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the norm of the wave vector; $h$ is the water depth; and $E(\sigma,\theta)$ is the wave energy density.

\subsection{Coupled model}
SLIM and SWAN are coupled together such that they share information in both ways at each time step (Fig. \ref{fig:coupling}). The two models are run consecutively at each time step. First, SLIM computes the sea surface elevation $\eta$ and depth-averaged current velocity $\mathbf{u}=(u,v)$. These quantities are transferred to SWAN to update the model water depth as well as the second term of equation \ref{eq:swan} governing wave energy propagation in the geographic space. Moreover, in order for the two model to have consistent bottom dissipation parameterizations, SLIM bottom drag coefficient is transformed into a roughness length $z_0$ following the methodology of \cite{dietrich2011hurricane}. This roughness length is then converted into Madsen's bottom dissipation term in SWAN. SWAN then produces the wave-induced force on current {\boldmath$\tau$}$_\text{wave}$ by computing the wave radiation stress gradient. This quantity is used to update the value of the surface stress {\boldmath$\tau$}$_s$ in equation \ref{eq:slim}, that now becomes the sum of wind and wave-induced forces {\boldmath$\tau$}$_s=${\boldmath$\tau$}$_\text{wind}+${\boldmath$\tau$}$_\text{wave}$. \textcolor{red}{TODO: Add some stuff}

\subsection{Validation}

\textcolor{red}{(reformulate sentence)}Comparisons of H*Wind wind and hybrid pressure fields with station measurements and ECMWF ERA-5 profiles at Vaca Key station are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:forcings}. The hybrid pressure field shows better agreement with observations than ERA-5 pressure as it successfully reproduces the storm depression. ERA-5 fields, on the other hand, fail to resolve the low pressure at the core of the hurricane due to their coarser grid \textcolor{red}{(TODO: add how much)}. Both H*Wind and ERA-5 agree well with observed wind speeds although both data sets tend to slightly overestimate the width and intensity of the wind peak. However, H*wind profiles show a better match with the timing of the observed peak, that ERA-5 winds tend to anticipate. H*wind also exhibits a slightly narrower peak in wind speed, which better agrees with observations.

    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{fig/validation_met_2.png}
    \caption{Comparison of reconstructed wind atmospheric pressure with field measurements and coarser ECMWF ERA-5 profiles during Irma. The generated hybrid atmospheric better capture the observed storm depression while H*wind winds better match the measured peak in wind speed.}
    \label{fig:forcings}
\end{figure}

Hydrodynamic outputs of the coupled wave-current agree well with tide gauge and ADCP measurements (Fig. \ref{fig:hydro}). The timing and amplitude of the storm surges are well reproduced by the coupled model, the largest model error being an overestimation of 18 cm of the elevation peak at Virginia Key. The fit is especially good at Naples, where both the positive and negative surges are captured by the coupled model with a 5 cm accuracy. This result is of interest as negative surges, although less studied, affect water exchanges between the estuaries and the coastal ocean and disturb the benthic ecosystems \citep{liu2020impacts}. Modelled 2D currents were validated against depth-averaged ADCP measurements at mooring station C10, C12 and C13 (\ref{fig:hydro}). As in \citep{liu2020impacts}, vector correlation analysis \citep{kundu1976ekman} is performed to compare modelled and observed current velocity vectors. Correlation coefficients ($\rho$) between simulated and observed depth-averaged currents were 0.84, 0.74 and 0.73 respectively C10, C12 and C13 locations respectively. Average veering angles were computed as well and were below 12$^\circ$, as in \citep{liu2020impacts}.\textcolor{red}{ However, in our case, no clear overestimation of southward currents was observed during Irma}. As expected from a depth-averaged model, the best fit with observations is obtained at the shallowest mooring C10, located on the 25m isobath, with an average veering angle of 6$^\circ$. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{fig/elevation_with_map.png}
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{fig/validation_currents_C10_ww3.png}
    \caption{Comparison of modelled sea surface elevation and current velocity with tide gauge measurements and observed velocity at mooring C10 (see Fig. \ref{fig:mesh} for their location). Timing and amplitudes of the storm surges are well reproduced by the model. Modelled current velocities agree well with observations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 and an average veering angle of $6^\circ$ at mooring C10.}
    \label{fig:hydro}
\end{figure}

The simulated significant wave height agrees well with observations on the WFS, where errors on the peak value fo not exceed \textcolor{red}{???} \%. On the East Florida Shelf, errors are slighly larger reaching \textcolor{red}{???} \%. Although the model outputs agree well with observations, a lag in significant wave height is observed for all 4 buoys. Moreover, the peak in significant wave height tends to be underestimated at buoys 41113 and 41114, located on the East Florida Shelf. Other wave parameters were better reproduced by the model on the WFS as well, as illustrated for buoy 42036 in Fig. \ref{fig:waves}. This good fit on the WFS is not surprising as the parameters used for wing energy input and whitecapping dissipation were based on the calibration performed by \citep{siadatmousavi2011evaluation} on the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Wind-induced wave growth might therefore be underestimated on the eastern shelf. Consequently, incident wave do not receive enough energy to grow after breaking on the bank boundary, leading to an underestimation of the significant wave height at the location of the buoys. Nonetheless, as this study focused on the wave produced by Irma , that made landfall on the western coasts of Florida, the use of parameterizations calibrated for the Gulf of Mexico seems reasonable.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Impact of waves on currents and transport}

The impact of hurricane-induced wave-current interactions is first evaluated by computing the norm of the maximum difference in current velocity between uncoupled SLIM and coupled SLIM+SWAN model runs during the passage of Irma through the Florida Keys (from 2017-09-07 to 2017-09-13). The differences in modelled currents appear to be stronger on the shelf break and over coral reefs (Fig. \ref{fig:diff}). These results highlight the significant impact of wave-induced forces, that can yield differences of up to 1 m/s during the hurricane, with stronger currents being obtained with SLIM+SWAN. This suggests that neglecting wave-current interactions during Irma would results in a significant underestimation of transport over reefs.

\begin{figure}

The difference between the coupled and uncoupled model, which represents the effect of the wave-induced stress, can yield differences of 0.5 m/s in the simulated currents during the passage of the hurricane. SLIM+SWAN currents velocities are larger than the currents modeled by SLIM alone. Islands are highlighted in dark grey and coral reefs in lighter grey}
    \label{fig:diff}
\end{figure}

To quantify the impact of these differences in velocity fields, we compared the trajectories of virtual particles driven by currents produced by SLIM alone and SLIM+SWAN simulations in the Florida Keys. First, we identified the areas where the differences between the modelled currents were the largest. Then, we determined the potential origination regions of particles reaching these areas on the passage of the hurricane through the Florida Keys using backtracking methods \citep{dobbelaerereport}. These regions are highlighted by the 4 release regions of Fig. \ref{fig:traj}. Finally, particles were released from these four regions and advected by currents produced by the coupled and uncoupled models. At each time step, the center of mass of the modelled particle clouds were computed. The distance between these centers of mass was used as a measure of the impact of the wind-generated wave coupling on the modelled current in the Florida Keys during hurricane Irma. This comparison was performed with 3 sets of currents: the currents modelled by uncoupled SLIM (SLIM); the currents modelled by coupled SLIM+SWAN (SLIM+SWAN); and the SLIM+SWAN currents with depth-averaged Stokes drift (SLIM+SWAN+Stokes) \textcolor{red}{[sentence is too condensed]}. The results of these comparisons are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:traj} \textcolor{red}{[reformulate as active sentence]}. Differences between the modelled trajectories are negligible before the passage of the hurricanes in the Florida Keys. Then, distance between the centers of mass of the particles abruptly increase to up to tens of kilometers as Irma gets through the Keys to finally stabilize after the passage of the hurricane. These results support the assumption that wave-induced transport is negligible compared to advection by Eulerian currents in fair weather conditions. Particles advected by the currents of the coupled model tend to remain on the shelf while particles advected by SLIM alone are mostly transported along the shelf break. Although not shown in this paper, comparison of SLIM and SLIM+SWAN trajectories were conducted as well. The evolution of the distance between centers of mass of the particle clouds showed similar trends while yielding smaller values. Modelled maximal depth-averaged Stokes drift reached up to 0.2 m/s during the passage of Irma through the Florida Keys. This suggests that both the impact of wave-induced force on Eulerian currents and Stokes drift should be taken into account while modelling particle transport under storm conditions.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}

Impact of waves on coral connectivity

Ability of wave model to correctly capture gradient in significant wave height due to current-waves interactions under tropical cyclones depends on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Broad perspective $\Rightarrow$ not limited to FL
    \item Mention search and rescue
    \item However, ignoring waves in storm conditions could result in significant inaccuracies in modelled trajectories, as illustrated in the case of release region 2 in Fig. \ref{fig:traj}
    \item Spatial (10km $\to$ 5km) and spectral (36 dir. $\to$ 48 dir.) resolution \citep{hegermiller2019wave}
    \item Directional spreading of incident waves \citep{villas2020wave}
\end{itemize}
